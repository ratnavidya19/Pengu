# Puzzle 3

Welcome to CS5400, this is your second programming assignment which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ggy6mf7bh_rfDcRHTvc8wxDmQbjw43bapGrMmU1S9I4/edit?usp=sharing). 
The assignment document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvH5KQ-KH5yby7uUOvyvSu_uF05gaw40jZUoozXY13c/edit?usp=sharing1). 
- For your third puzzle assignment, you will be implementing ID-DFS. 
- You can use C, C++, Mono C#, Python 3, JavaScript, Typescript, and Java. 
- You should develop, test, and submit your assignments in a matter compatible with the Computer Science Departments's Linux systems, which will be used for grading.
- Programs will be graded (on a scale from 0 to 100) on multiple criteria, of which the most important is correctness. Complete and correct output for every test input case is necessary, but not sufficient, for a full score.
- An auto-grader will be used to help the TA's during the grading process. Therefore it is of supreme importance that you comply with the assignment's input and output format.
- When your assignment is complete and ready, modify the content of the included 'ReadyForGrading.txt' file to 'Yes'. Also include the language you are programming in within the 'ReadyForGrading.txt' file as well. When including your langauge, write the langauge in **all lower case** with no version numbers (python will be assumed to be python3). This is how you will indicate to the graders that your assignment is ready to be graded as there is a late policy in this class.

- Please make sure you have a working run.sh before submitting.
